        <b>The weight loss pace</b> indicates both your current weight loss trend and the pace you need to follow to
        reach your goal,
        specifying the weekly and monthly rates. This app automatically calculates these rates based on your registers
        and your goal. <br><br>
        If values like <b>"Not Logic"</b> are shown, it's because those weight trends shouldn't be considered due to
        insufficient data.
